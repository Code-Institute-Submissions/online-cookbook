        "01": " For the sausages, melt the butter in a large non-stick frying pan and fry the leek gently for 8-10minutes, or until very soft but not coloured.",
        "06": " Sprinkle with the sugar and pour over the vinegar. bring to a simmer and cook for five further minutes, or until the liquid is well reduced and the relish becomes thick and glossy. remove from the heat, set aside to cool for a few minutes then tip into a serving dish.",
        "07": " Heat the oil into a large non-stick frying pan and fry the sausages over a medium heat for 10-12 minutes, turning regularly until golden-brown and crisp. serve the sausages with a good spoonful of chilli and onion relish and some thinly sliced runner beans.",
        "04": " Whisk the egg whites lightly in a bowl with a large metal whisk until just frothy. sprinkle 40g/1½oz breadcrumbs over a large plate. dip the sausages one at a time into the beaten egg and roll in the breadcrumbs until evenly coated, then place on the baking tray. chill the sausages in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
        "05": " Meanwhile, for the relish, heat the oil in a large non-stick saucepan and fry the onions for 20 minutes, or until very soft and just beginning to colour. add the chilli and garlic to the pan and cook for a further five minutes, stirring regularly."
